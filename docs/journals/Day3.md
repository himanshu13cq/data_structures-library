Today I started implementing the Dynamic Array after completing its design proposal. Before writing the implementation, I learned about multi-file projects, header guards and how to use CMake to manage the project structure. I implemented the Rule of Three, append(), resizing logic and operator[] for the Dynamic Array. While implementing these functions, I understood why the assignment operator returns a reference instead of void and why operator[] should return T& instead of T.

After completing the Dynamic Array, I started implementing the Linked List. During this I learned how template classes should be organized using a .tpp file and why the .tpp file needs to be included at the end of the header file. I also understood that constructing a Node using placement new automatically constructs the data member of type T.

Finally, I completed the Linked List implementation and reorganized both data structures using the CMake project structure. While implementing insertion and deletion, I had to think carefully about edge cases like inserting into an empty list and deleting the only node in the list. After understanding these cases, I updated the head and tail pointers correctly.

Overall, today was mainly focused on converting the design proposals into working code and understanding how templates, memory management and project structure work together in a C++ library.
